## Working with code

For proposing changes, use the standard [pull request approach](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). It's recommended to discuss fixes or new functionality in the Issues, first.

## Commiting changes

The project follows [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) for committing changes.

## How to publish

The package is automatically published on every push to `master` branch if there are relevant changes.
