# @theunderscorer/nx-semantic-release

[nx](https://nx.dev/) plugin for automated releases, powered
by [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

## Installation

Run:

```shell
npm install -D @theunderscorer/nx-semantic-release
```

For now this package supports only <b>Independent</b> versioning mode, synced mode is planned to be added soon.

## Usage

In order to release your projects, add this executor to your configuration file (ex. `workspace.json`), bare minimal
configuration looks like this:

```json
{
  "semantic-release": {
    "executor": "@theunderscorer/nx-semantic-release:semantic-release",
    "options": {
      "buildTarget": "my-app:build",
      "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/YourName/YourRepo",
      "outputPath": "dist/apps/my-app"
    }
  }
}
```

After running this, the executor will do the following:

* Filter commits retrieved by semantic-release in order to find only these that affects selected project or it's
  dependencies.
* Perform semantic-release using following plugins (in this order:)
  * @semantic-release/commit-analyzer
  * @semantic-release/release-notes-generator
  * @semantic-release/changelog
  * @semantic-release/npm
  * @semantic-release/git
  * @semantic-release/github
* The result will be a fully versioned project. If you are releasing it as npm package, the package will be built,
  version in package.json will be updated and package itself will be published.

### Available Tokens

| Token           | Expands into                                                                                  |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ${PROJECT_DIR}  | Resolves to the current project direcory (ex. `/Users/theunderscorer/nx-monorepo/apps/app-a`) |
| ${PROJECT_NAME} | Resolves to the current project name (ex. `app-a`)                                            |

The following options support tokens: `buildTarget`, `changelogFile`, `commitMessage`, `gitAssets`, `packageJsonDir`, and `tagFormat`.

You may see other tokens like `${nextRelease.version}`, those are tokens that are replaced by semantic-release itself.

#### Build target

By setting `buildTarget` option plugin will run your build executor as part of the release, which is useful if ex. you
want to publish released package to npm registry.

#### Skipping commits

You can skip commits for given project using `[skip $PROJECT_NAME]` in its body. Ex:

```
  feat: update something
  
  [skip my-app]
```
During analysis this commit will be skipped for release pipeline for my-app.

You can also use `[skip all]` to skip commit for all projects..

### CI/CD

Example of GitHub actions workflow:

```yaml
name: default

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'master'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: configure git
        run: |
          git config user.name "${GITHUB_ACTOR}"
          git config user.email "${GITHUB_ACTOR}@users.noreply.github.com"

      - run: npm ci

      - run: npx nx run my-app:semantic-release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Development

After cloning repo run:

```shell
npm install
```

It will also automatically setup test workspace at `test-repos/app` directory.

In order to run tests run:

```shell
npm run test
```
